# Translators - 2019/2

This is the repository for the Translators class.

All documents are written in Portuguese, the rest in English.

## 1 - Theme Selection

First part of the project, where we must define the target language of our future Translator.

The language must have basic features, such as simple IO, function calls, arithmetic expressions, loops and conditionals, besides a complex feature (not found in C for example).
